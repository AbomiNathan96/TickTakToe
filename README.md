idk what to put here i im going to write down how it works

first the storage system

012345678
is the same as
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
is how the positions are stored

this also stores time-ish
012345678   123056784
X0X0X0X0X   X0X0X0X0X

X 0 X
0 X 0
X 0 X

so if you count up and remove all the 9's and double digits then you all the games possible
then run all the games to get the outcome and bam all the games stored

then just use that data to only do the best moves
